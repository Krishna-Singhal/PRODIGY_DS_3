# Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchases

## Overview

This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used for this analysis.

The project was developed with the assistance of Prodigy Infotech and aims to provide a robust predictive model that helps in identifying potential customers.

## Features

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A model that predicts customer purchase behavior based on input features such as age, occupation, and previous interactions.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the most significant factors influencing customer decisions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
